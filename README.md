# StS-Damage-Calculator

This is a web application I created in R to calculate the amount of damage dealt in the video game, Slay the Spire, based on certain conditions. For example, strength gained, vulnerable and weak.

The calculator only works for the Ironclad at this time. 

To use the web application, download the zip file, open the "Damage Calculator" R project and open the "app" file, which is in "Sts_dmg_calc". Then simply click run app.
